 <!-- plaintext paragraph with an embedded link attached to the words "several things/ingredients" -->
<p>There are 
<a href="https://bellyfull.net/the-best-scrambled-eggs/">several things/ingredients</a> 
that you will need to scramble an egg. Among them are a good pan, I prefer non-stick, a rubber spatula (if you are using a non-stick pan), and all of your ingredients. Using a metal spatula on a non-stick pan can ruin the pan and make the non-stick surface significantly less efective. As a general rule for ingredients, simpler is better. Eggs are pretty simple: don't too much! All you need is a few good ingredients and practice; a great comprehensive list is outlined in the link above!</p>

<h2>Execution</h2> <!-- h2 heading for second entry in TOC -->

 <br>

<!-- plaintext paragraph with an embedded link attached to the words "this one" -->
<p>There are countless reciepes on the internet regarding how to scramble an egg, but
<a href="https://www.incredibleegg.org/recipes/basic-scrambled-eggs/">this one</a>
will give you some of the best results. Admittedly, scrambling an egg is a pretty simple task, but little, nuanced changes can lead to an even better outcome. Some of these little things include: not adding seasoning too early and adding other additions in an unusual order. Again, as simple as eggs are, there's almost a learning curve to it. Making these little changes can bring your breakfast from okay to great!</p>

 <h2>Enjoyment!</h2> <!-- h2 heading for third entry in TOC -->

  <br>

<!-- plaintext paragraph with an embedded link attached to the words "something with them" -->
<p>You can always eat scrambled eggs plain, but eating
<a href="https://greatist.com/eat/scrambled-egg-recipes-to-keep-breakfast-interesting">something with them</a>
can make it even better. There are so many great options: from adding vegetables to the eggs to making other dishes to go alongside. Eggs are the cornerstone of any great breakfast, so long as you know what you're doing!</p>
